### Search for Reservation
> Logged-in/Authenticated user searches for a car. The view is not filtered for reservation availability.

![All Reservations](figs/SearchForCar.png)

#### Notes
- The first header indicates the title of the view along with the authenticated user's name and balance.
- The second header indicates whether the view is filtered/not-filtered. If not-filtered, the user is presented with an input-form to enter dates to filter reservations.
- The body shows images of each car in the reservation inventory, with a corresponding name of the car, description, and price for the rental. In this figure, no filter has been applied and therefore each car in the inventory is displayed regardless of availabilty. Each car has a button to reserve, if available.
