> Scrum Master: Carter Watson
### What we did well
* Colaborated - in person work
* pivoting changing priorty
* changing when things didn't go to plan
* communication between members helping each other with issues
### What didn't go well
* Didn't put as much work into this sprint as we shouldve
* Sprint planning didn't work well - focus on front end wasn't efficient
* Scope for tickets 
* lack of infrastructure
### What we can improve on
* Put more hours in
* reevaluate the scope of the next two sprints before milestone 3
* lack of infrastructure - create design docs, and all backend models
* scope for tickets - better descriptions
### Measurement criteria for improvements
* Hours worked
* pivot from the frontend, backend, tie together model we had for the three sprints this milestone to something that allows us to get more work done efficiently
* create design document/style guide
* more in terms of description for tickets

* Carter Watson - 25%
* Joe Giles - 25%
* Caden Maxwell - 25%
